# LUA-Projects

Welcome to the LUA Projects!

There are 3 projects, in each folder you will find the source code along with any other folder used to create the prject such as plug ins and sprites. Do focus on the "main.lua" files since these contain the mayority (if not all) of the code.

These projects were created throught the Udemy course: Lua Programming and Game Development with Love2D
